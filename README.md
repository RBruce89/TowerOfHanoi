# Introduction

This is my take on the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game. The game is usually set up as three posts, with at least three disks on the left post. The disks range in size with the smallest on the bottom and the largest on the top. The object is to move all the disks to the right post, one at a time,  without placing any disk on a smaller disk.

## Features

* Drag and drop driven play
* Select amount of game pieces, from 3 to 7
* Moves are counted, and game is timed 

## Technical information

Tower of Hanoi was written in C#.NET version 4.6.1
using Visual Studio version 15.027428.1
